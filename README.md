# Resnet Dashboard
Dashboard for ResNet

Current Stuff:
- [x] Choose stack (Flask + jQuery)
- [ ] Draw out data flow for the app (Flask->Python->jQuery)
- [ ] Figure out how to use WhenIWork API

How to actually launch the website:
Make sure you have pipenv installed, alongside Python 3.6.4. You should be able to to run "pipenv install" in the project directory to install dependencies.
Next, run "pipenv shell". This opens a virtual environment with all the packages installed.
Run "flask run" to start the website. You can now navigate to the address listed in the output of that command to see the site (for me it was http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
